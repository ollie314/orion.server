** FINAL WARNING ** Cleaning up the files you had in Orion
As was previously indicated, it is planned to delete your Orion workspace at <URL> on <DELETIONDATE> due to inactivity.  Note that this will delete only the contents of the online work area, with no impact on anything that is committed to your repositories. If you wish to retain your workspace then log on to Orion at <URL> before <DELETIONDATE>, and this will be taken to mean that you still want to keep the contents around.

Thanks
The Eclipse Orion Team
